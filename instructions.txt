React JSX Practice and Event Handling - Using Create-React-App

Step One: Create a new simple react application using create react app

    Check that you have node and npm installed
    Create a new directory to place today's work
    run: npx create-react-app in-class-20190225
    Import other items
        cd pizza-bandit
        npm install --save bootstrap
        npm install --save jquery
        npm install --save popper.js
        npm install --save mapbox-gl
        npm install --save react-mapbox-gl
    Modify the index.js and App.js files to create referecnces

Step Two: Create a new Github Repository and use Git to create a local repository that syncs with your Github repository

    git init - THIS IS ONLY DONE ONCE PER REPOSITORY - YOU NEVER RUN THIS AGAIN
    git add -A - adds the files in this directory 
    git commit -m "a useful message describing this update here" - you do this every time you create a new update
    Create a github repository
    copy the git remote command there
    git push -u origin master - Push to the github repository

Step Three: Create a simple Component-based form using JSX

    Create a ReactJS Component to handle input for an email
    Create a ReactJS Component to  input for a password
    Create a ReactJS Component to serve as a parent to all form elements
    Create a button for submission in the form Componet
    Create an App Component to serve as the parent for all children components

Step Four: Introduce a event handler methods

    Create an event handlers for:
        The email input
        The password input
        The button
    Validate form input
        ensure the email is correct
        check to see that the password is 8 characters or more and has at least 1 number and one capitalized letter
    Show form input in a separate div:
        show the results from the form as JSX output in a separate DIV

Step Five: Create a Simple React-Mapbox component

    Create a Map element with appropriate Layer and Feature children
    Obtain position using Geolocation
    Update map in the ReactJS componentDidMount lifecycle method
